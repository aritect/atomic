<Title>Introduction</Title>
<Description>What is Atomic?</Description>

Welcome to Atomic, the toolkit designed to simplify and enhance development process that I use in my projects.

Inspired by the best of the best, including Radix, Tailwind, Shadcn UI and more, Atomic brings together the most popular and widely used components into one convenient package for reuse between projects.

While Atomic is currently in a private registry, I've excited to give you a sneak peek into development process through this documentation. Think of it as a backstage pass, complete with examples, usage instructions, and a glimpse into what's coming next.
